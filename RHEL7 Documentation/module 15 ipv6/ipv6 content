NetworkManager Overview

    NetworkManager: System daemon that manages configuration of network interfaces

    Device: Network interface

    Connection: Collection of settings that can be configured for a device

        Only one connection is active at a time

        Multiple connections may exist

            Use for different devices

            Allows device configuration to be altered

        Each connection is identified by name or ID

        Persistent configuration is stored in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-name

        To create or edit connection files from shell prompt, use nmcli
------------------------------------------------------
IPv4 Networking Review
Viewing Networking Information

    To show status of all network devices, use nmcli dev status

    [student@demo ~]$ nmcli dev status
    DEVICE  TYPE      STATE         CONNECTION
    eno1    ethernet  connected     eno1
    eth0    ethernet  connected     static-eth0
    eno2    ethernet  disconnected  --
    lo      loopback  unmanaged     --

    To show all connections, use nmcli con show

    To show only active connections, add --active

    [student@demo ~]$ nmcli con show
    NAME         UUID                                  TYPE            DEVICE
    eno2         ff9f7d69-db83-4fed-9f32-939f8b5f81cd  802-3-ethernet  --
    static-eth0  72ca57a2-f780-40da-b146-99f71c431e2b  802-3-ethernet  eth0
    eno1         87b53c56-1f5d-4a29-a869-8a7bdaf56dfa  802-3-ethernet  eno1
    [root@demo ~]# nmcli con show --active
    NAME         UUID                                  TYPE            DEVICE
    static-eth0  72ca57a2-f780-40da-b146-99f71c431e2b  802-3-ethernet  eth0
    eno1         87b53c56-1f5d-4a29-a869-8a7bdaf56dfa  802-3-ethernet  eno
-----------------------------------
IPv4 Networking Review

    To see configuration of network interfaces, use ip addr show

    To show single interface, use interface name as last argument:

    [student@demo ~]$ ip addr show eth0
    2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST, UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000 
        link/ether 52:54:00:00:00:0b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff 
        inet 192.168.0.101/16 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global eth0 
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        inet6 fe80::5054:ff:fe00:b/64 scope link 
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
--------------------------------------------------
IPv4 Networking Review
Adding Network Connections

    To add new network connections, use nmcli con add and unique name

        Example: Add new connection for eno2, get IPv4 networking information using DHCP, and autoconnect on startup

        [root@demo ~]# nmcli con add con-name eno2 type ethernet ifname eno2

        Example: Configure eno2 interface statically, use IPv4 address and network prefix 192.168.0.5/24, use default gateway 192.168.0.254, and autoconnect at startup

        [root@demo ~]# nmcli con add con-name eno2 type ethernet ifname eno2 \
        > ip4 192.168.0.5/24 gw4 192.168.0.254
---------------------------------------------------
IPv4 Networking Review
Controlling Network Connections

    To activate connection name on network interface it is bound to, use nmcli con up name

        Command takes connection name, not network interface name

        [root@demo ~]# nmcli con up static-eth0

    To disconnect network interface device and bring it down, use nmcli dev disconnect device

        Can abbreviate command as nmcli dev dis device

        [root@demo ~]# nmcli dev dis eth0
----------------------------------------------------------
IPv4 Networking Review

    To deactivate a network interface, use nmcli dev dis device

    Avoid nmcli con down name to deactivate network interface

        Brings down connection temporarily

        Most wired connections use autoconnect

        Because network interface is available, NetworkManager brings connection up immediately

            Unless connection is entirely disconnected from interface
----------------------------------------
IPv4 Networking Review
Modifying Network Connection Settings

    Two kinds of NetworkManager connections:

        Static: Properties configured by administrator and stored in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*

        Active: Properties obtained from DHCP server and are not stored persistently

    To list current settings for a connection, use nmcli con show name

        Static properties that can be changed appear in lowercase

        Active settings in use by current connection instance appear in uppercase
-----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
IPv4 Networking Review

    To change connection settings, use nmcli con mod name

        Changes saved in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-name

        Example: Set IPv4 address to 192.0.2.2/24 and default gateway to 192.0.2.254 for connection static-eth0

        [root@demo ~]# nmcli con mod static-eth0 ipv4.addresses "192.0.2.2/24 192.0.2.254"

    When changing connection type from active to static, set ipv4.method to manual

	For more info on NetworkManager settings, see the nm-settings(5) man page.
---------------------------------------------------------
IPv4 Networking Review

    Some settings can have multiple values

        To add or delete specific setting values, add + or - to setting name

        Example: Add DNS server 192.0.2.1 to nameserver list for static-eth0 connection

        [root@demo ~]# nmcli con mod static-eth0 +ipv4.dns 192.0.2.1

    Changes made with nmcli con mod name are saved to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-name

        Can also manually edit this file

        To make NetworkManager read manual changes, run nmcli con reload

    For backward-compatibility, directives saved in that file have different names and syntax from nm-settings(5) names
-----------------------------
IPv4 Networking Review

nmcli con mod
	

ifcfg-* File
	

Purpose

ipv4.method manual
	

BOOTPROTO=none
	

Configures static IPv4 addresses.

ipv4.method auto
	

BOOTPROTO=dhcp
	

Looks for configuration settings from DHCPv4 server. If static addresses are also set, does not bring them up until has information from DHCPv4.

ipv4.addresses "192.0.2.1/24 192.0.2.254"
	

IPADDR0=192.0.2.1 PREFIX0=24 GATEWAY0=192.0.2.254
	

Sets static IPv4 address, network prefix, and default gateway. If more than one is set for connection, then instead of 0, the ifcfg-* directives end with 1, 2, 3, and so on.

ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8
	

DNS0=8.8.8.8
	

Modifies /etc/resolv.conf to use this nameserver.

ipv4.dns-search example.com
	

DOMAIN=example.com
	

Modifies /etc/resolv.conf to use this domain in search directive.

ipv4.ignore-auto-dns true
	

PEERDNS=no
	

Ignores DNS server information from DHCP server.

connection.autoconnect yes
	

ONBOOT=yes
	

Automatically activates this connection at boot.

connection.id eth0
	

NAME=eth0
	

Name of connection.

connection.interface-name eth0
	

DEVICE=eth0
	

Binds connection eth0 to network interface.

802-3-ethernet.mac-address . . .
	

HWADDR= . . .
	

Binds connection with this MAC address to network interface.
-----------------------------------------------------
IPv4 Networking Review
Editing Network Settings

    NetworkManager directly modifies /etc/resolv.conf, so edits to that file may be overwritten

    To change settings in /etc/resolv.conf, set DNSn and DOMAIN directives in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* files instead

Deleting a Network Connection

    Use nmcli con del name to:

        Delete name connection

        Disconnect name from device

        Remove /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-name file

Modifying the System Hostname

    To display or temporarily modify fully qualified hostname, use hostname

    [root@demo ~]# hostname
    demo.example.com
---------------------------------------------------
IPv4 Networking Review
Setting Static Hostname

    To specify a static hostname in /etc/hostname, use hostnamectl

        Also use hostnamectl to modify /etc/hostname and view status of fully qualified hostname

    If file does not exist, hostname is set by reverse DNS query after interface has IP address

    [root@demo ~]# hostnamectl set-hostname demo.example.com
    [root@demo ~]# hostnamectl status
       Static hostname: demo.example.com
             Icon name: computer
               Chassis: n/a
            Machine ID: 9f6fb63045a845d79e5e870b914c61c9
               Boot ID: aa6c3259825e4b8c92bd0f601089ddf7
        Virtualization: kvm
      Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.0 (Maipo)
           CPE OS Name: cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7.0:GA:server
                Kernel: Linux 3.10.0-121.el7.x86_64
          Architecture: x86_64
    [root@demo ~]# cat /etc/hostname
    demo.example.com

    	Previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux stored the hostname as a variable in /etc/sysconfig/network.

IPv6 Networking Concepts
IPv6 Overview

    IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4 network protocol

        Uses larger network address space to resolve exhaustion of IPv4 addresses

        Provides enhancements and new features for network configuration management

        Supports future protocol changes

    IPv6 is not in wide deployment

        Not simple for IPv6 systems to communicate with IPv4 systems

    Best transition plan is to provide all hosts with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

        Internet resources using only one protocol can be reached from host

        Called dual-stack configuratio
-------------------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts
Transition Methods in Development

    Other transition methods in development:

        Allow IPv6-only hosts to use IPv4 Internet

        Support other forms of IPv4/IPv6 translation

            NAT64 (RFC 6145)

            464XLAT (RFC 6877)

    Position of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF):

        Operators using IPv4 should obtain IPv6 prefix

        Turn on IPv6 routing in network and between themselves and upstream/downstream neighbors

        Enable it and use it in normal processing while

        Leave IPv4 stable until either protocol can be used

            Then turn off IPv4 off (RFC 6144, Introduction)
-----------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts
IPv6 Addresses

    IPv6 address is 128-bit number

        Expressed as 8 colon-separated groups

        Each group is 4 hexadecimal nibbles (half-bytes)

        Each nibble is 4 bits of IPv6 address

        Each group represents 16 bits of address

        2001:0db8:0000:0010:0000:0000:0000:0001
-------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts

    No need to write leading zeros in group

        Must write at least one nibble in each field

        Must write zeros that follow nonzero nibble in group

        2001:db8:0:10:0:0:0:1

    Long strings of zeros are common

        To combine groups of consecutive zeros, use exactly one :: block

        2001:db8:0:10::1

    Alternate way to write example address

        Equally valid but less convenient method

        2001:db8::0010:0:0:0:1
------------------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts
Tips for Writing IPv6 Addresses

    Always suppress leading zeros in group

    Use :: to shorten

        If two runs of zeros are equal length, shorten one on left

    Although allowed, do not use :: to shorten one group of zeros

        Use :0: instead, and save :: for runs of zeros longer than single group

    Always use lowercase letters for hexadecimal numbers a through f

	

When including a TCP or UDP network port after an IPv6 address, always enclose the IPv6 address in square brackets so the port does not look like part of the address.
[2001:db8:0:10::1]:80
-----------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts
IPv6 Subnets

    Normal unicast address has 2 parts: network prefix and interface ID

    Network prefix identifies subnet

    On subnet, no 2 network interfaces can have same interface ID

    Interface ID identifies particular interface on subnet

    IPv6 has standard subnet mask, usually /64

        Half of address is network prefix and half is interface ID

        Means single subnet can hold as many hosts as necessary
-----------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts
IPv6 Subnets

    Normal unicast address has 2 parts: network prefix and interface ID

    Network prefix identifies subnet

    On subnet, no 2 network interfaces can have same interface ID

    Interface ID identifies particular interface on subnet

    IPv6 has standard subnet mask, usually /64

        Half of address is network prefix and half is interface ID

        Means single subnet can hold as many hosts as necessary
------------------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts

    Typically, network provider allocates shorter prefix to organization, such as /48

    Leaves rest of network part for assigning subnets from that allocated prefix

        A /48 allocation leaves 16 bits for subnets (up to 65536 subnets)
------------------------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts

IPv6 Address or Network
	

Purpose
	

Description

::1/128
	

localhost
	

IPv6 equivalent to 127.0.0.1/8, set on loopback interface.

::
	

Unspecified address
	

IPv6 equivalent to 0.0.0.0. For network service, could indicate service listening on all configured IP addresses.

::/0
	

Default route (the IPv6 Internet)
	

IPv6 equivalent to 0.0.0.0/0. Default route in routing table matches this network. Router for this network receives all traffic for which there is no better route.

2000::/3
	

Global unicast addresses
	

"Normal" IPv6 addresses are currently allocated from this space by IANA. Equivalent to all networks ranging from 2000::/16 to 3fff::/16.

fd00::/8
	

Unique local addresses (RFC 4193)
	

IPv6 has no direct equivalent of RFC 1918 private address space, although this is close. Site can use these to self-allocate private routable IP address space inside the organization, but these networks cannot be used on global Internet. Site must randomly select a /48 from this space, but it can subnet allocation into /64 networks normally.

fe80::/64
	

Link-local addresses
	

Every IPv6 interface automatically configures link-local address that works only on local link on this network. Discussed in more detail later.

ff00::/8
	

Multicast
	

IPv6 equivalent to 224.0.0.0/4. Multicast is used to transmit to multiple hosts at same time, and is particularly important in IPv6 because it has no broadcast addresses.
-----------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts
Link-Local Addresses

    Unroutable address used only to talk to hosts on specific network link

    Every network interface is automatically configured with link-local address on fe80:: network

    To ensure link-local address is unique, interface ID is constructed from interface’s Ethernet hardware address

    Procedure to convert 48-bit MAC address to 64-bit interface ID is to set bit 7 of MAC address and insert ff:fe between two middle bytes

        Network prefix: fe80::/64

        MAC address: 00:11:22:aa:bb:cc

        Link-local address: fe80::211:22ff:feaa:bbcc/6
---------------------------------------------

        Link-local address: fe80::211:22ff:feaa:bbcc/64
------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts

    Link-local addresses of other machines can be used like normal addresses by other hosts on same link

    Because every link has fe80::/64 network on it, routing table cannot be used to select outbound interface correctly

    When talking to link-local address, specify scope identifier at end of address

        Scope identifier has % followed by network interface name

        Example: Use ping6 to ping link-local address fe80::211:22ff:feaa:bbcc via link connected to eth0 network interface:

        [student@demo ~]$ ping6 fe80::211:22ff:feaa:bbcc%eth0

    Use scope identifiers only when contacting addresses that have "link" scope

    Use normal global addresses same as IPv4

        Select outbound interfaces from routing table
-----------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts
Multicast

    Multicast has larger role in IPv6 than IPv4

        IPv6 has no broadcast address

    Key IPv6 multicast address is all-nodes link-local address: ff02::1

    Ping ff02::1 to send traffic to all nodes on link

    Link-scope multicast addresses (starting ff02::/8) need scope identifier

        Similar to link-local address

        [student@demo ~]$ ping6 ff02::1%eth0
        PING ff02::1%eth0(ff02::1) 56 data bytes
        64 bytes from fe80::211:22ff:feaa:bbcc: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.072 ms
        64 bytes from fe80::200:aaff:fe33:2211: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=102 ms (DUP!)
        64 bytes from fe80::bcd:efff:fea1:b2c3: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=103 ms (DUP!)
        64 bytes from fe80::211:22ff:feaa:bbcc: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.079 ms
--------------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts
IPv6 Address Configuration

    IPv4 addresses are configured manually by administrator and dynamically by DHCP

    IPv6 supports manual configuration and 2 dynamic configuration methods, including DHCPv6

Static Addressing

    Can select Interface IDs for static IPv6 addresses same as IPv4

    In IPv4, lowest and highest subnet addresses are reserved

    In IPv6, these interface IDs are reserved and cannot be used for normal network host address:

        All-zeros identifier 0000:0000:0000:0000

            "Subnet router anycast" used by all routers on link

            For 2001:db8::/64 network, address is 2001:db8::

        Identifiers fdff:ffff:ffff:ff80 through fdff:ffff:ffff:ffff
--------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts
DHCPv6 Configuration

    DHCPv6 works differently from DHCP for IPv4

        No broadcast address

    Host sends DHCPv6 request from its link-local address to port 547/UDP on ff02::1:2 (all-dhcp-servers link-local multicast group)

    DHCPv6 server sends appropriate reply to port 546/UDP on client’s link-local address

    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 supports DHCPv6 server via dhcp package
----------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts
SLAAC Configuration

    IPv6 supports SLAAC as second dynamic configuration method

    Host brings up its interface with link-local fe80::/64 address

    Sends "router solicitation" to ff02::2 (all-routers link-local multicast group)

    IPv6 router on local link responds to host’s link-local address with network prefix

    Host uses network prefix with interface ID

        Constructed same way as link-local addresses

    Router periodically sends multicast updates ("router advertisements") to confirm or update information

    radvd package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 allows IPv6 router to provide SLAAC through router advertisements

SLAAC Configuration

    IPv6 supports SLAAC as second dynamic configuration method

    Host brings up its interface with link-local fe80::/64 address

    Sends "router solicitation" to ff02::2 (all-routers link-local multicast group)

    IPv6 router on local link responds to host’s link-local address with network prefix

    Host uses network prefix with interface ID

        Constructed same way as link-local addresses

    Router periodically sends multicast updates ("router advertisements") to confirm or update information

    radvd package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 allows IPv6 router to provide SLAAC through router advertisements
---------------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Concepts

    Typical machine configured to get IPv4 addresses through DHCP is usually configured to use SLAAC to get IPv6 addresses

    Can result in machine’s unexpectedly obtaining IPv6 addresses when IPv6 router is added to network

    Some IPv6 deployments combine SLAAC and DHCPv6

        Use SLAAC to provide only network address information

        Use DHCPv6 to provide other information, such as which DNS servers and search domains to configure

IPv6 Networking Configuration
NetworkManager and IPv6

    All IPv4 commands work with IPv6

        Some connection settings are different

        Most configuration commands are similar

Adding an IPv6 Network Connection

    To add new network connections, use nmcli con add

        Example: Add new connection for eno2 interface

            Autoconnect at startup

            Get IPv4 networking information using DHCPv4

            Listen for router advertisements on local link

            [root@demo ~]# nmcli con add con-name eno2 type ethernet ifname eno2
-------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Configuration

    To configure eno2 interface statically:

    [root@demo ~]# nmcli con add con-name eno2 type ethernet ifname eno2 \
    > ip6 2001:db8:0:1::c000:207/64 gw6 2001:db8:0:1::1 ip4 192.0.2.7/24 gw4 192.0.2.1
-----------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Configuration
Modifying Network Connection Settings for IPv6

    To view IPv6-related settings, use nmcli con show name

    [root@demo ~]# nmcli con show static-eth0 | grep ipv6
    ipv6.method:                  manual
    ipv6.dns:                     2001:4860:4860::8888
    ipv6.dns-search:              example.com
    ipv6.addresses:               { ip = 2001:db8:0:1::7/64, gw = 2001:db8:0:1::1 }
    ipv6.routes:
    ipv6.ignore-auto-routes:      no
    ipv6.ignore-auto-dns:         no
    ipv6.never-default:           no
    ipv6.may-fail:                yes
    ipv6.ip6-privacy:             -1 (unknown)
    ipv6.dhcp-hostname:           --
    [root@demo ~]#
-------------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Configuration

    To adjust how connections set IPv6 addresses, also use nmcli con mod name

        Example: To set IPv6 address to 2001:db8:0:1::a00:1/64 and default gateway to 2001:db8:0:1::1 for connection static-eth0:

        [root@demo ~]# nmcli con mod static-eth0 ipv6.address "2001:db8:0:1::a00:1/64 2001:db8:0:1::1"

    When changing connection type from SLAAC or DHCPv6 to static, set ipv6.method to manual
------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Configuration

    Some settings can have multiple values

        To add or delete specific setting values, add + or - to setting name

    Example: Add DNS server 12001:4860:4860::8888 to nameserver list for static-eth0 connection

    [root@demo ~]# nmcli con mod static-eth0 +ipv6.dns 2001:4860:4860::8888

    Static IPv4 and IPv6 DNS settings all end up as nameserver directives in /etc/resolv.conf

        Recommended minimum configuration:

            IPv4-reachable nameserver (assuming a dual-stack system)

            At least one nameserver using each protocol

    Can manually edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-name

        To make NetworkManager read manual changes, run nmcli con reload
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Viewing IPv6 Networking Information

    These commands work same as IPv4:

        nmcli dev status shows status of all devices

        nmcli con show lists available connections

        ip addr show displays current configuration of network interfaces

    Example: Items relevant to IPv6

    [student@demo ~]$ ip addr show eth0
    2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000

-------------------------------------------------------------
IPv6 Networking Configuration

    To show IPv6 routing table, use ip -6 route show

    [root@demo ~]# ip -6 route show
    unreachable ::/96 dev lo  metric 1024  error -101
    unreachable ::ffff:0.0.0.0/96 dev lo  metric 1024  error -101
    2001:db8:0:1::/64 dev eth0  proto kernel  metric 256
    unreachable 2002:a00::/24 dev lo  metric 1024  error -101
    unreachable 2002:7f00::/24 dev lo  metric 1024  error -101
    unreachable 2002:a9fe::/32 dev lo  metric 1024  error -101

    unreachable 3ffe:ffff::/32 dev lo  metric 1024  error -101
    fe80::/64 dev eth0  proto kernel  metric 256
    default via 2001:db8:0:1::ffff dev eth0  proto static  metric 1024

    Ignoring unreachable routes that point at never-used networks leaves three routes:

        To 2001:db8:0:1::/64 network, using eth0 interface (presumed to have network address)

        To fe80::/64 network, using eth0 interface for link-local address

            On system with multiple interfaces, will be route to fe80::/64 out of each interface for each link-local address

        Default route to all networks on IPv6 Internet (::/0 network) without specific route on system

            Through router at 2001:db8:0:1::ffff

            Reachable with eth0 device
