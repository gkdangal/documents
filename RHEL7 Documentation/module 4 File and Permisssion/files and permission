File/Directory Permissions

    To change permissions from command line, use chmod

        Short for change mode

        Permissions are also called mode of a file

    chmod takes permission instruction followed by list of files or directories to change

    Permission instruction: Symbolic or numeric
--------------------------------------------------------
File/Directory Permissions
Symbolic Method

chmod WhoWhatWhich file|directory

    Letters represent permission groups:

        Who: u (user), g (group), o (other), a (all)

    Change existing permission set or add new set:

        What: + (add), - (remove), = (set exactly)

    Letters represent actual permissions:

        Which: r (read), w (write), x (execute)
-----------------------------------------------------



File/Directory Permissions
Numeric Method

chmod ### file|directory

    Permissions represented by three-digit octal number

        Four digits for advanced permissions

    Each digit represents an access level: user, group, other

    Each digit equals sum of permissions: read (r)=4, write (w)=2, execute (x)=1
--------------------------------------------


File/Directory Permissions
Permissions Command Examples

    To remove read and write permission for group and other on file1:

    [student@desktop1$ chmod go-rw file1

    To add execute permission for everyone on file2:

    [student@desktop1$ chmod a+x file2

    To set read, write, and execute permission for user; read and execute for group; and no permission for other, on sampledir:

    [student@desktop1$ chmod 750 sampledi

---------------------------
File/Directory Permissions
-R Option

    Use to recursively set permissions on entire directory tree

    Use X permissions (not x)

        Indicates setting permissions on directories, not files

        Example: Set read and write access on demodir and children for group owner

        [student@desktop1# chmod -R g+rwX demodir
---------------------------------------------------

Ownership

    User who creates file is owner of file

    Owner’s primary group has group ownership of file

        Often owner is only member of group

    May need to change owner or group to grant access to file

--------------------------------------------------------------

Ownership
Change File Ownership

    To change owner, use chown

        Example: Change owner of file foofile to student

        [root@desktop1 ~]# chown student foofile

    To recursively change ownership of entire directory tree, use chown with -R option

        Example: Grant ownership of foodir and all files and subdirectories to student

        [root@desktop1 ~]# chown -R student foodir
----------------------------------------------------
Change Group Ownership

    To change group ownership of file, use chown

    Precede group name with :

        Example: Change group foodir to admins

        [root@desktop1 ~]# chown :admins foodir

---------------------------------------------------------
Ownership
Change Both File and Group Ownership

    To change owner and group at same time, use chown

    Use syntax owner:group

        Example: Change owner of foodir to visitor and group to guests

        [root@desktop1 ~]# chown visitor:guests foodir

    Only root can change file ownership

    root or file owner can set group ownership

        root can grant ownership to any group

        Non-root can grant ownership to groups to which they belong

Ownership
Use chgrp

    To change group ownership, can use chgrp

    Works same as chown, including use of -R

	For more info on permissions and ownership, see the following man pages: ls(1), chmod(1), chown(1), and chgrp(1).

Special Permissions
setuid Permissions

    Runs command as user or group of file, not user that ran command

        Example: passwd command

        [student@desktop1$ ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
        -rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 35504 Jul 16  2010 /usr/bin/passwd

    setuid permissions use s in place of x

        If no owner execute permissions, S replaces x

---------------------------------------------------------
Ownership

    To change owner and group at same time, use chown

    Use syntax owner:group

        Example: Change owner of foodir to visitor and group to guests

        [root@desktop1 ~]# chown visitor:guests foodir

    Only root can change file ownership

    root or file owner can set group ownership

        root can grant ownership to any group

        Non-root can grant ownership to groups to which they belong
----------------------------------------------
Ownership
Use chgrp

    To change group ownership, can use chgrp

    Works same as chown, including use of -R

	For more info on permissions and ownership, see the following man pages: ls(1), chmod(1), chown(1), and chgrp(1).

---------------------------------------------------
Special Permissions
setuid Permissions

    Runs command as user or group of file, not user that ran command

        Example: passwd command

        [student@desktop1$ ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
        -rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 35504 Jul 16  2010 /usr/bin/passwd

    setuid permissions use s in place of x

        If no owner execute permissions, S replaces x
-----------------------------------------------------
Special Permissions
sticky Permissions

    Sets restriction on deletion of files

        Only file owner and root can delete files in directory

        Example: /tmp

        [student@desktop1$ ls -ld /tmp
        drwxrwxrwt. 39 root root 4096 Feb  8 20:2 /tmp

    sticky permissions use t in place of x

        If no owner execute permissions, T replaces x
---------------------------------------------------------
Special Permissions
setgid Permissions

    Indicates files in directory inherit group affiliation from directory, not from creating user

    Used on group collaborative directories to change file from default private group to shared group

    Can spot setgid permissions by s in place of x

        If no group execute permissions, S replaces x

---------------------------------------------------
Special Permission
Effect on Files	
Effect on Directories

u+s (setuid)
	

File executes as user that owns file, not user that ran file
	

No effect

g+s (setgid)
	

File executes as group that owns file
	

Group owner of newly created files in directory is same group owner as directory

o+t (sticky)
	

No effect
	

Users with write permissions on directory can remove files they own; they cannot remove or force saves to files owned by other users

-----------------------------------------------------

Special Permissions
Setting Special Permissions

    Symbolically

        setuid = u+s

        setgid = g+s

        sticky = o+t

            Example: Add setgid on directory

            [root@desktop1 ~]# chmod g+s directory

    Numerically (fourth preceding digit)

        setuid = 4

        setgid = 2

        sticky = 1

            Example: Set setgid, read/write/execute for user and group on directory

            [root@desktop1 ~]# chmod 2770 directory
-----------------------------------------------------
Default File Permissions

    Default file permissions set by processes that create them

        Example: Text editors create files that are readable and writeable, but not executable

    mkdir creates directories with all permissions set: read, write, execute

        Permissions typically not set when creating files and directories

        Some permissions cleared by umask of shell process

    umask without arguments displays current value of shell’s umask:

    [student@desktop1$ umask
    0002
-------------------------------------

Default File Permissions
umask

    umask - Octal bitmask used to clear permissions of files and directories that process creates

    If bit is set in umask, corresponding permission is cleared in files

        Example: umask 0002 clears write bit for other users

            Leading zeros indicate special, user, and group permissions not cleared

        umask 077 clears all group and other permissions of newly created files

    umask with single numeric argument changes umask of current shell

        Numeric argument indicates new umask value

        If fewer than three digits, leading zeros assumed

    Default umask values for Bash shell users defined in /etc/profile and /etc/bashrc

    Can override system defaults in .bash_profile and .bashrc
-----------------------------------------------------
Default File Permissions
Step 5: Log in as root to change default umask for unprivileged users

    Prohibit all access for users not in their group

    Modify /etc/bashrc and /etc/profile to change default umask for Bash shell users

    Default umask for unprivileged users is 0002

    Locate 0002 values and set umask to 007 for unprivileged users

    [root@desktop1 ~]# less /etc/bashrc
        # You could check uidgid reservation validity in
        # /usr/share/doc/setup-*/uidgid file
        if [ $UID -gt 199 ] && [ "`id -gn`" = "`id -un`" ]; then
           umask 002
        else
           umask 022
        fi

        # Only display echos from profile.d scripts if we are no login shell
    [root@desktop1 ~]# vim /etc/bashrc
    [root@desktop1 ~]# less /etc/bashrc
        # You could check uidgid reservation validity in
        # /usr/share/doc/setup-*/uidgid file
        if [ $UID -gt 199 ] && [ "`id -gn`" = "`id -un`" ]; then
           umask 007
        else
           umask 022
        fi

        # Only display echos from profile.d scripts if we are no login shell
    [root@desktop1 ~]# less /etc/profile
        # You could check uidgid reservation validity in
        # /usr/share/doc/setup-*/uidgid file
        if [ $UID -gt 199 ] && [ "`id -gn`" = "`id -un`" ]; then
            umask 002
        else
            umask 022
        fi

        for i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh ; do
    [root@desktop1 ~]# vim /etc/profile
    [root@desktop1 ~]# less /etc/profile
        # You could check uidgid reservation validity in
        # /usr/share/doc/setup-*/uidgid file
        if [ $UID -gt 199 ] && [ "`id -gn`" = "`id -un`" ]; then
            umask 007
        else
            umask 022
        fi

        for i in /etc/profile.d/*.sh ; do
---------------------------------------------
Default File Permissions
Step 6: Log back in as student

    Confirm that umask changes are persistent

    [student@desktop1$ umask
    0007

    Other shells may have different system default initialization files
------------------------------------------------
POSIX ACL Concepts

    Access Control Lists (ACLs): Provide fine-grained access control to files and directories

    Can grant permissions to:

        Named users or named groups

        Users and groups identified by a UID or GUID

        File owner, group owner, other

    Same r, w, x permission flags

    File owner can set ACLs on files or directories

    New files and subdirectories can inherit ACL settings from parent default ACLs

    Parent hierarchy needs other execute permission to give access to named users and named groups
-------------------------------
File System Mount Option

    Need to mount file system with ACL support enabled

    XFS® file systems have built-in ACL support

    Ext4 file systems in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 have acl enabled
---------------------------------------------

File System Mount Option

    Need to mount file system with ACL support enabled

    XFS® file systems have built-in ACL support

    Ext4 file systems in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 have acl enabled

	Ext4 file systems created after installation in earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux may need the acl option included with the mount request, or set in the superblock.
------------------------------------------------
ACL Permissions

    ls -l outputs minimal ACL setting details:

    [student@server1 steamies]$ ls -l roster.txt
    -rwxrw----+ 1 student controller 130 Mar 19 23:6 roster.txt

    + indicates ACL settings associated with this file

    user: Shows user ACL settings

        Same as standard user file settings: rwx

    group: Shows ACL mask settings

        Not group owner settings: rw

    other: Shows other ACL settings

        Same as standard other file settings: no access

    Using chmod to change group permissions on file with ACL does not change group owner permissions, but does change ACL mask

        To change file’s group owner permissions:

        setfacl -m g::perms file
-------------------------------------------


File ACLs

    To display ACL settings on a file, use getfacl file :

    [student@server1 steamies]$ getfacl roster.txt
    # file:roster.txt
    # owner:student
    # group:controller
    user:rwx
    user:ames:---
    user:005:rwx       #effective:rw-
    group:rwx          #effective:rw-
    group:odor:r--
    group:210:rwx      #effective:rw-
    mask:rw-
    other:---

	The next few slides discuss each section of this example in detail.
------------------------------
File ACLs
Group Entries

group:rwx          #effective:rw- 1
group:odor:r-- 2
group:210:rwx      #effective:rw-  3

Mask Entry

mask:rw-

Other Entry

other:---
---------------------------------------

Directory ACLs

    To display ACL settings on a directory, use getfacl /directory:

    [student@server1 steamies]$ getfacl .
    # file:.
    # owner:student
    # group:controller
    # flags:-s-
    user:rwx
    user:ames:---
    user:005:rwx
    group:rwx
    group:odor:r-x
    group:210:rwx
    mask:rwx
    other:---
    default:ser::rwx
    default:ser:james:---
    default:roup::rwx
    default:roup:sodor:r-x
    default:ask::rwx

-------------------
Directory ACLs
Default ACL Mask Entry

default:ask::rwx

Default Other Entry

default:ther::---

    Default entries do not include named user or named group

        Initial ACL entries not added automatically to new files or subdirectories

        Limits entries to files and subdirectories on which they already have ACLs, or if owner adds ACL using setfacl

        Can still create files and subdirectories

    Can use output from getfacl as input to setfacl
---------------------------------------------------
ACL Mask

    ACL mask: Defines maximum permissions granted to named users, group owner, named groups

    Does not restrict permissions of file owner or other users

    All files and directories that implement ACLs have ACL mask

    To view mask, use getfacl

    To set mask, use setfacl

    Mask automatically calculated and added if not set

        Can inherit from parent default mask setting

    When you add, modify, or delete affected ACL, mask recalculates by default

ACL Permission Precedence

    Process running as user that owns file: File’s user ACL permissions apply

    Process running as user listed in named user ACL entry: Named user ACL permissions apply (if mask permits)

    Process running as group that matches group owner of file, or as group with explicit named group ACL entry: Matching ACL permissions apply (if mask permits)

    Otherwise: File’s other ACL permissions apply

	For more info on ACLs, see the following man pages: acl(5), getfacl(1), ls(1).

ACL File Permissions

    To add, modify, or remove standard ACLs, use setfacl

    ACLs use normal r, w, x, - representation for permissions

    X indicates:

        Set execute permission on directories, not files

        Unless file already has relevant execute permission

        Same behavior as chmod

------------------------------------
ACL File Permissions
Add or Modify an ACL

    Options for adding or replacing ACLs:

        Set via command line using -m

        Pass in via file using -M

            Use - instead of file name for stdin

    Other ACL entries on file or directory remain untouched

    Use --set or --set-file to completely replace ACL settings on file

    If ACL add does not include file owner, group owner, or other permissions:

        System uses base ACLs (current standard file permissions)

            Base ACLS cannot be deleted

        System calculates and adds new mask value
-------------------------------------------------
ACL File Permissions
Add or Modify a User or Named User ACL

[student@server1 ~]$ setfacl -m u:name:rX file

    If name left blank, applies to file owner

    Otherwise name can be username or UID value

    ACL and standard file owner permissions are equivalent

        Using chmod or setfacl on file owner permissions is equivalent

        chmod does not effect named users
----------------------------------------
ACL File Permissions
Add or Modify a User or Named User ACL

[student@server1 ~]$ setfacl -m u:name:rX file

    If name left blank, applies to file owner

    Otherwise name can be username or UID value

    ACL and standard file owner permissions are equivalent

        Using chmod or setfacl on file owner permissions is equivalent

        chmod does not effect named users
------------------------------
ACL File Permissions
Add or Modify a Group or Named Group ACL

[student@server1 ~]$ setfacl -m g:ame:rw file

    If name left blank, applies to group owner

    Otherwise name can be group name or GID value for named group

    chmod does not effect group permissions for files with ACL settings

        Updates ACL mask
-----------------------------------------
ACL File Permissions
Add or Modify a Group or Named Group ACL

[student@server1 ~]$ setfacl -m g:ame:rw file

    If name left blank, applies to group owner

    Otherwise name can be group name or GID value for named group

    chmod does not effect group permissions for files with ACL settings

        Updates ACL mask
------------------------------------------
ACL File Permissions
Add or Modify the Other ACL

[student@server1 ~]$ setfacl -m o::- file

    Other accepts permission settings only

        Commonly set to -

        Can specify any standard permission

    ACL and standard other permissions are equivalent

        Using chmod or setfacl on other permissions is equivalent
----------------------------------------------------
Add Multiple Entries

    Can add multiple entries in same command

    Comma-separate each entry:

    [student@server1 ~]$ setfacl -m u:rwx,g:sodor:rX,o::- file

    In this example:

        File owner: Read, write, execute

        Named group sodor: Read-only and conditional execute

        All other users: No permissions

        Group owner: Maintains existing file or ACL permissions

        Other named entries: Unchanged
----------------------------------------------
getfacl as Input

    Can use output from getfacl as input to setfacl:

    [student@server1 ~]$ getfacl file-A | setfacl --set-file=- file-B

        --set-file accepts input from file or stdin

        - specifies use of stdin

        file-B has same ACL settings as file-A
---------------------------------------
Explicit ACL Mask

    Can explicitly set ACL mask on file or directory

    Limits maximum permissions for named users, group owner, and named groups

    Restricts permissions that exceed mask

    No impact on permissions less permissive than mask

    [student@server1 ~]$ setfacl -m m:r file

        Adds mask value that restricts named users, group owner, and named groups to read-only permission

        No impact to file owner and other users

    getfacl displays effective comment beside entries restricted by mask setting

    By default, ACL mask recalculates each time ACL is modified or deleted

        Potentially resets previous explicit mask setting

        To avoid recalculation, use -n or include mask setting (-m m::perms) with setfacl that modifies mask-affected ACL
-----------------------------------------------
Recursive ACL Modifications

    To apply ACL recursively to directory structure and files, use -R

    Can use X with recursion

        Files with execute permission retain setting

        Sets execute permissions for directories to allow directory search

    Recommended: Use X when non-recursively setting ACLs

        Prevents administrator from accidentally adding execute permissions to regular file

        [student@server1 ~]$ setfacl -R -m u:ame:rX directory

        Adds username to directory, existing files, and subdirectories

        Grants read-only and conditional execute
------------------------------------------------------
ACL Deletion

    Deletion is same as modify, but do not specify :perms

    [student@server1 ~]$ setfacl -x u:name,g:name file

        Removes named user and named group from list of file or directory ACLs

        Other ACLs remain active

    Can use delete (-x) and modify (-m) in same setfacl

    Can delete mask only if no other ACLs set

        Base ACLs cannot be deleted

        Must delete mask last

    File no longer has ACLs

    ls -l does not show + next to permissions string

    To delete all ACLs on file or directory (including default ACLs on directories):

-----------------------------------------------

Default ACL Permissions

    Can set default ACLs on directory

        New files and subdirectories automatically inherit

    Can set default ACL permissions for each standard ACL settings, including default mask

    Directory still requires standard ACLs for access control

        Default ACLs do not implement access control for directory

        Only provide ACL permission inheritance support

        [student@server1 ~]$ setfacl -m d:u:name:rx directory

            Adds default named user (d:u:name) with read-only permission and execute permission on subdirectories
------------------------
Default ACL Permissions

    Can set default ACLs on directory

        New files and subdirectories automatically inherit

    Can set default ACL permissions for each standard ACL settings, including default mask

    Directory still requires standard ACLs for access control

        Default ACLs do not implement access control for directory

        Only provide ACL permission inheritance support

        [student@server1 ~]$ setfacl -m d:u:name:rx directory

            Adds default named user (d:u:name) with read-only permission and execute permission on subdirectories
-----------------------------------------------
Default ACL Permissions
Using setfacl

    Same as for standard ACLs

        Preface with d: or use -d option

    When setting default ACLs on directory, include execute permission

        Ensures users can access contents of new subdirectories created in directory

        Users do not automatically get execute permission set on newly created regular files

            ACL mask of a new regular file is rw-

    New files and subdirectories get owner UID and primary group GID values set from creating user

        Exception: When parent directory setgid is enabled, primary group GID is same as parent directory GID
----------------------------------
Default ACL Permissions
Deleting Default ACLs

    Same as deleting standard ACL

        Preface with d: or use -d option

        [student@server1 ~]$ setfacl -x d:u:name directory

        Removes default ACL added previously

    To delete all default ACLs on directory, use setfacl -k /directory

    To delete all ACLs on directory, use setfacl -b /directory

	For more info on securing files with ACL, see the following man pages: acl(5), setfacl(1).
