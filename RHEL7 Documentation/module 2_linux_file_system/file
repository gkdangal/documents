File System Terms

    Static: Content that remains unchanged until explicitly edited or reconfigured

    Dynamic or variable: Content that is modified or appended by active processes

    Persistent: Content, particularly configuration settings, that remains after a reboot

    Runtime: Process- and system-specific content and attributes that are cleared during a reboot
------------------------------------------------------------
/usr=>

Installed software, shared libraries, include files, and static read-only program data. Important subdirectories include:

    /usr/bin: User commands

    /usr/sbin: System administration commands

    /usr/local: Locally customized software
----------------------------------------------
/etc =>

Configuration files specific to system.
-------------------------------------------
/var => dynamically changed files.

Variable data specific to system that should persist between boots. Under /var are files that dynamically change.

Examples: Databases, cache directories, log files, printer-spooled documents, and website content.
=======================================
Symbolic link Directory

Symbolic Link Directories

    Older directories in / now have the same content as their counterparts in /usr:

        /bin = /usr/bin

        /sbin == /usr/sbin

        /lib == /usr/lib

        /lib64 == /usr/lib64

    Formerly these were distinct directories with different files

    Directories in / are symbolic links to matching directories in /usr

-====================================================================
copy command
cp
cp -p
cp -r for directory compy

rename and move files and folder.
mv
remove files and folder
rm
rm -f
rm -rf
-i promting oposite of f
-f not promting
make directory
mkdir
mkdir -p
-p is parent option
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hard Links

    Hard link: Directory entry that references a file

        Every file has one hard link by default

    To save space, create hard link instead of copying file

    If created in same directory as existing hard link, hard link must have different file name

        Or create hard link in different directory

    All hard links pointing to file have same:

        Permissions

        Link count

        User/group ownerships

        Time stamps

        Content
Example: Create hard link newfile-link2.txt for file newfile.txt in same directory

[root@server1 ~]# ln newfile.txt /tmp/newfile-hlink2.txt
[root@server1 ~]# ls -l newfile.txt /tmp/newfile-hlink2.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 2 root root 12 Mar 11 19:9 newfile.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 2 root root 12 Mar 11 19:9 newfile-hlink2.txt
