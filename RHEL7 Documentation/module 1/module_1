    When first invoked, redhat-support-tool prompts for subscriber login information

        To avoid repetitively supplying credentials, tool asks to store account info in $HOME/.redhat-support-tool/redhat-support-tool.conf

        If account is shared by many users, use --global option to save account info and systemwide configuration to /etc/redhat-support-tool.conf

    To modify toolâ€™s configuration settings, use config
