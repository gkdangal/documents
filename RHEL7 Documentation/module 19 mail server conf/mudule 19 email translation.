---------------------------------------
Email Architecture and Null Clients

    Linux servers send email to report errors and to administrators

        Generally use /usr/sbin/sendmail

        Most servers send mails when incidents occur

        Uses corporate SMTP server to transmit messages

    Null client: Client machine that runs local mail server that forwards emails to outbound mail relay for delivery

        Does not accept local delivery for any messages

        Can only send messages to outbound mail relay

    Users may run mail clients on null client to read and send emails
--------------------------------------------------------
Email Message Transmission

    To send email, mail client communicates with outgoing mail server

        Server helps relay message to final destination

        Client uses SMTP to transmit messages to server

    If outgoing mail relay requires no authentication from internal clients, server listens on port 25/TCP

        Relay restrict hosts that can relay

        IP address-based restrictions or firewall rules

    If outbound SMTP relay is reachable from Internet, normally configured as MSA

        MSA listens on port 587/TCP and requires authentication of client before accepting mail

        May be username/password or other means

    Outgoing mail relay uses DNS to look up MX record

        Identifies mail server that accepts delivery for messages sent to recipient domain

    Relay uses SMTP on port 25/TCP to transmit email to server
--------------------------------------------------------------
    Recipient mail service may provide POP3 or IMAP server to let mail client download messages

    Mail service may provide web-based interface to let clients use web browser as mail client

    Mail client on desktop1.example.com fetches incoming mails from IMAP server imap1.example.com

    Outgoing mails sent to smtp1.example.com

    MX DNS record defines smtp1.example.com as mail server for example.com
-----------------------------------------------------
Postfix

    Postfix: Powerful, easy-to-configure mail server

        Default mail server in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

        Provided by postfix RPM package

        Modular program made up of several programs

        Components controlled by master process

    /etc/postfix/main.cf: Main configuration file of postfix mail server

        /etc/postfix contains other configuration files

        /etc/postfix/master.cf controls subservices that are started
------------------------------------------------
Setting
	

Purpose
	

Default

inet_interfaces
	

    Controls network interfaces Postfix listens on for incoming and outgoing messages

        If set to loopback-only, Postfix listens only on 127.0.0.1 and ::1

        If set to all, Postfix listens on all network interfaces

    Can list One or more host names and IP addresses, separated by white space

	

inet_interfaces = localhost

myorigin
	

    Rewrite locally posted email to appear to come from this domain

    Helps ensure responses return to correct domain for which mail server is responsible

	

myorigin = $myhostname

relayhost
	

    Forward all messages to mail server specified supposed to be sent to foreign mail addresses

    Square brackets around host name suppress MX record lookup

	

`relayhost = `

mydestination
	

    Configure domains mail server is end point for

    Email addressed to these domains delivered into local mailboxes

	

mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost

local_transport
	

    Determine how to deliver email addressed to $mydestination

    By default, set to local:$myhostname

        Uses local mail delivery agent to deliver incoming mail to local message store in /var/spool/mail

    Set to error: error message, e.g., local_transport = error: local delivery disabled, to disable local delivery completely

	

local_transport = local:$myhostname

mynetworks
	

    Allow relay through mail server from comma-separated list of IP addresses and networks in CIDR notation to anywhere, without further authentication

    If mynetworks not explicitly set in /etc/postfix/main.cf, is filled automatically using setting for mynetworks_style

    Default for mynetworks_style: subnet

        Means all subnets in which tserver has IP address are added to mynetworks

        Often not desired situation, especially if server has external IP address

    Recommended: Add mynetworks setting manually, or set mynetworks_style to host

	

mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::1]/128

--------------------------------------------------------------Postfix
Edit Configuration File

    Two ways to edit /etc/postfix/main.cf:

        By hand using a text editor such as vim

        Using postconf utility

    postconf lets you:

        Query by individual/all settings

        Modify settings

        Query defaults

        Showing all settings that differ from built-in defaults
------------------------------------------------------
Postfix

    To query all settings from /etc/postfix/main.cf, run postconf without any parameter:

    [root@server1 ~]# postconf
    2bounce_notice_recipient = postmaster
    access_map_defer_code = 450
    access_map_reject_code = 554
    address_verify_cache_cleanup_interval = 12h
    address_verify_default_transport = $default_transport
    ...

    To query particular set of options, list them after postconf

        Example: To list inet_interfaces and myorigin options with corresponding values:

        [root@server1 ~]# postconf inet_interfaces  myorigin
        inet_interfaces = loopback-only
        myorigin = $myhostname

    If value in /etc/postfix/main.cf starts with $, it is not a literal value

        Instead points to value of different setting

        Syntax simplifies maintenance; need to update value in one place only
---------------------------------------------------
    To add or change options in /etc/postfix/main.cf:

    postconf -e 'setting = value'

        If setting with name already exists in configuration file, it is updated to new value

        Otherwise it is added to bottom of configuration file

    To change myorigin to rewrite domain part of FROM: address to example.com:

    [root@server1 ~]# postconf -e 'myorigin = example.com'

	postfix requires reload or restart after making changes to /etc/postfix/main.cf.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Postfix
Troubleshooting

    When troubleshooting email, log of all mail-related operations kept in systemd and /var/log/maillog

        Includes information on mail server-related actions

    To display list of queued outgoing mail messages, use postqueue -p

    To attempt to deliver all queued messages again immediately, use postqueue -f command

        Otherwise, Postfix attempts to resend once an hour until messages accepted or expire
--------------------------------------------------

Postfix Null Client Configuration

    To act as null client, must configure Postfix and Red Hat Enterprise Linux so that:

        sendmail and programs that use it forward all emails to existing outbound mail relay for delivery

        Local Postfix service does not accept local delivery for any email messages

        Users may run mail clients on null client to read and send emails

    Null client on server1.example.com delivers all messages to corporate SMTP mail server smtp1.example.com

For a complete overview of all settings adjustable in /etc/postfix/main.cf and their explanations, see the postconf(5) man page.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Postfix Null Client Configuration
Steps

    Adjust relayhost to point to corporate mail server:

        Enclose host name of corporate mail server in square brackets

        [root@server1 ~]# postconf -e "relayhost=[smtp1.example.com]"

    Configure Postfix mail server to only relay emails from local system

        Let mail server listen on loopback interface for emails to deliver only:

        [root@server1 ~]# postconf -e "inet_interfaces=loopback-only"

        Change null client configuration so it forwards mails originating from 127.0.0.0/8 IPv4 network and [::1]/128 IPv6 network to relay host:

        [root@server1 ~]# postconf -e "mynetworks=127.0.0.0/8 [::1]/128"

    Configure Postfix so outgoing mails have sender domain rewritten to company domain example.com:

    [root@server1 ~]# postconf -e "myorigin=desktop1.example.com"
---------------------------------------------------------
Postfix Null Client Configuration

    Prohibit Postfix mail server from delivering messages to local accounts

        Configure the null client not to act as end point for any mail domain:

            Does not accept mails where recipient is local email account for local delivery

            Need to set mydestination to empty value

            [root@server1 ~]# postconf -e "mydestination="

        Configure local null client not to sort mails into mailboxes on local system:

            Local email delivery turned off

            [root@server1 ~]# postconf -e "local_transport=error: local delivery disabled"

    Restart local postfix null client:

    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl restart postfix
