Demonstrate Deploying a Binary Container Lab
Scenario

The scenario for this demonstration lab is that a developer wants to deploy the latest Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3 container to their project.
1. Demonstrate Authentication to OpenShift Master

    Action: Log in to the OPENTLC shared OpenShift web console using either of these methods:

        Method 1: Go to https://master.na1.openshift.opentlc.com

        Method 2: Use the command line from any host with the OpenShift client utility (oc) installed:

        LocalMachine$ oc login https://master.na1.openshift.opentlc.com --username shacharb-redhat.com
        Username: shacharb-redhat.com
        Password: **********
        Logged into "https://master.na1.openshift.opentlc.com" as "shacharb-redhat.com" using existing credentials.

2. Demonstrate Creating a Project

    Action: Click New Project to create a project for your demonstration:
    Demo01 New Project Button

        Explain what projects are and how different projects can have different user permissions and quotas attached to them.

    Action: Fill in the Name, Display Name, and Description fields:
    Demo02 Create Project Details
    	Project names need to be unique in an OpenShift environment. Should you get an error that the project name is already taken add your initials or a similar unique string to your project name.
    	

    Two other options for completing this task:

        Use the command line from any host with the OpenShift client utility (oc) installed:

        [sborenst@ip-192-168-20-158 ~]$ oc new-project nexus-binary-demo --description="This is the project to host the Nexus binary deployment demonstration" --display-name="Hosted Nexus Environment"
        Now using project "nexus-binary-demo" on server "https://master.na.openshift.opentlc.com".

        Run the oc new-project nexus-binary-demo command without the description and display name information.

3. Demonstrate Deploying a Binary Container

    Action: Click Deploy Image after creating your project or after clicking Add to project:

    Demo03_Select_Deploy_Image

    Action: Enter sonatype/nexus3 in the Image Name field.

        Explain that you are entering an image name to point to the official Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3 container hosted by Sonatype outside of OpenShift.

    Action: Click search_icon (Search).

    Demo04_Binary_Image_Name

        Explain the following aspects of the Environment Variables and Labels sections:

            How labels are used in OpenShift and how easy it is to label new deployments.

            How environment variables are used in OpenShift and how easy it is to set environment variables such as user names, database names, and others to modify deployment.

    Action: When you are done, click Create:

    Demo05_Env_Vars_and_Create

    Action: From the Application created page, click Continue to overview:

    Demo06_Application_Created

        Explain the following aspects of the Project Overview page:

            Point out the Nexus3 service created by OpenShift for this deployment (first arrow on the left).
            	The first deployment can take a few minutes because Nexus is setting up a few things internally. Wait until the status ring turns solid blue before continuing (see screenshot below).

            Point out the deployment’s Pod replica count and explain that you can scale the application by adding and removing nodes using this button.

            Demo07_Overview_Page_Create_Route

    Action: When you are done, click Create Route to create a route for the Nexus3 service.

        Explain how the Create Route page allows you to set the following aspects of the route creation:

            The Hostname field allows you to set any DNS name for your application (as long as the DNS resolves to the OpenShift routers).

            The Path field can be used with your URL (i.e., www.mywebsite.com/portal).

            The Service list lets you select which service the route should point to.

            The Target Port list lets you select which network port the route directs traffic to.

            Checking Secure route lets you set different TLS settings for your route.

    Action: When you are done, click Create to create a route for the application:

    Demo08_Create_Route_Details

        Explain that a route has been created for your application that points to your service and eventually to your pods.
        	It can take a few seconds for the router to get the latest routes. If your page doesn’t display right away, give it a few seconds, then refresh.

    Action: Right-click the route’s link on the top right and select Open link in new tab:

    Demo09_Click_Route_To_App

        Explain that the application has been deployed, and that you can click Sign in at the top right with admin as the user and admin123 as the password.

        Demo10_Application_Page_Signin

4. Cleanup

If you are not going do do any additional demonstrations go back to the OpenShift Homepage and delete your project.
5. Additional Demonstrations

You can do the following optional demonstrations:

    Show adding storage to a container (select nexus3 as the volume name).

    Show scaling a deployment up and down.

    Show metrics and logging for a container.
