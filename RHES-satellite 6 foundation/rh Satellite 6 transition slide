-----------------------------
History of Satellite 5 and 6
Satellite 5

    Available since 2002

    2002 technologies

    Limited flexibility given the changing IT landscape

Satellite 6

    General availability 2014

    2014 technologies

    Meets the needs of new computing models and technologies
-------------------------------------------------------
Transitioning From Satellite 5 to 6

    Dramatic technology upgrades require detailed attention

    Satellite 5 to 6 is more of a transition than a traditional upgrade

        Stand up

        Duplicate

        Migrate

        Decommission and archive

    Customer sets upgrade pace: days, weeks, or months
---------------------------------------------
Things to Consider
Architecture: Satellite Proxy Server and Satellite Capsule Server

    Satellite Capsule Server does more than Satellite Proxy Server did.

    Having one Satellite 5.x server and four Proxy servers does not mean that you should deploy one Satellite 6.x server and four Capsule servers.

        Not a one-to-one correspondence between Proxy Servers and Capsule Servers

        Installations may require more or fewer Capsule servers than Proxy servers
-------------------------------------------------------------
Things to Consider
Standard Operating Environment (SOE)

    Is your SOE worth transitioning in full or in part?

    Do you like the setup of your organizations, users, content, kickstarts, system groups, etc.?

    Are there other aspects of your SOE you want to assess?

------------------------------------------------------
Enabling Resources
Documentation

    Traditional documentation

    Knowledgebase articles

    Recommended practices

People

    Support and consulting services

    Red Hat Training

Tools

    Duplicate operational objects and constructs with minimal errors

    Automate repetitive and long-running processes
----------------------------------------------
Business Prerequisites

    Visit https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite and search for "Transitioning From Red Hat Satellite 5 to Version 6."

    Request transition subscriptions to facilitate the migration.

    After receiving the request, Red Hat:

        Validates that the account has valid subscriptions.

        Grants a Satellite and Capsule transition subscription for each valid Satellite and Proxy subscription.

    Transition subscriptions expire in 1 year.

    Free subscriptions are to be used only to transition.

    Download the transition application: https://access.redhat.com/articles/1187643

    Acquire a Satellite 6 manifest and put some subscriptions in the manifest.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Passive Transition Strategy

    Satellite 6 is treated as new technology, with little to no transition.

    SOE models are similar to Satellite 5, but use Satellite 6 as an opportunity to rethink IT infrastructure models and processes.

    Existing systems are left on Satellite 5 until they are retired because:

        They are known to be good (if not broken, do not fix it)

        They cannot be transitioned from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or earlier

    New systems are deployed on Satellite 6.

    Timeline: Satellite 5 and Satellite 6 will coexist.
--------------------------------------------------------
Active Transition Strategy

    Satellite 6 is an upgrade.

        An attempt is made to transition SOEs and workloads as closely as possible.

    Most, or all, systems move from Satellite 5 to Satellite 6.

    The goal is a single new Satellite 6 implementation.

    There are two SOE options:

        If the Satellite 5 SOE is good, model the Satellite 6 on it and move systems to it.

        If the Satellite 5 SOE is outdated, treat Satellite 6 as new technology, build a new SOE, and move only systems from Satellite 5 to 6.

    Timeline: Satellite 5 exists only for the duration of the transition.

Many customers combine the passive and active approaches

Client Migration
Prerequisites

    Hammer import content-host command has completed (to migrate system profiles)

    Profile transition RPM is created

    The sat5to6 script exists on each client system

sat5to6 script

    Query its Satellite 5 parent for a consumer-id

    Load appropriate PEM files onto the client machines

    Register itself to a specified Satellite 6 instance, attaching to the content-host UUID

    Manage the left-behind Satellite 5 profile:

        keep - Leave the Satellite 5 profile alone

        unentitle - Leave the profile but remove all subscriptions and entitlements (default)

        purge - Delete the profile entirely
