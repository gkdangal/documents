---------------------------------------------------------
rising cpst of IT
Complexcity and coat grows over time
operational expenses account for over 50% of overal IT infrastructure costs

More complexity = higher operational Cost.

---------------------------------------------
The cost of complexity
=> increase donwn time
=> Chalange for management
=> Secirity concern
=> disparate process
=> Delaying Provisioning
=> Large IT staff (more people need with deep undestanding)
=> Interoperability Issue
-------------------------------------------
Simplified infrastructure for higher Efficiency
=> Non-Standardized environment require more time to manage
=> Standardized environment is not require more time.

Benefits of a Standardized Operating Environment

    Simplified infrastructure

    Easier management and administration

    Less downtime

    Increased automation and efficiency

    Higher productivity
------------------------------------
Component Of Red hat Satellite
________________
Provisioning

    Provision to bare-metal, private, and public clouds

    Federate content delivery

    Discover non-provisioned hosts
--------------------------------------
Configuration Management

    Define desired state of systems

    Enforce compliance to configuration standards

    Audit and report when changes are made
---------------------------------------
Software Management

    Define and manage standard operating environments

    Respond quickly to security vulnerabilities (Heartbleed/ShellShock)

    Deploy scalable and secure patching policies

    Manage releases centrally
------------------------------------------
Subscription Management

    Centrally governed subscription usage

    Accurate inventory and utilization information

    Helps “buy-up, re-up, true-up”

    Reporting

Red Hat Satellite Components

Satellite Server
-> Multi-Tenant
Multi-tenancy means that a single instance of the software and all of the supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers. Each customer shares the software application and also shares a single database.

-> On promise Repository Management
-> User and Group role based access Control(RBAC)
-> powerfull User Interfaces(GUI, API, and ClI)
-> Advanced Subscription management.

Satellite Capsule Server
-> Federated services
-> Automated Provisioning
-> Discovery Of new physical and virtual machines

Smart management
------------
Required for each subscription managed via satellite.
