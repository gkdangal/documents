Finally, we have Galaxy.

Ansible Galaxy completes our “batteries included” story by giving you access to thousands upon thousands of user-contributed roles, playbooks, and modules.

With the ansible-galaxy command line, you can use roles directly from this repo, but you can also easily download and customize the roles locally before running them in your environment.

The great thing about Galaxy is that no matter what you’re trying to automate, there’s a good chance that someone else has done it, so why not learn from them? It helps you do real work with Ansible that much faster.
