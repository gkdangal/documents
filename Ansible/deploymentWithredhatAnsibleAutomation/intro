In this module, you learn the following:

    Ansible is an agentless configuration management tool built on Python.

    Ansible is installed on the control node and keeps its configuration files there.

    Ansible copies modules from the control node to the managed hosts, where it executes them in the order specified in the playbook.

    Ansible is ideal for deploying applications in parallel on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, JBoss, and OpenShift Enterprise, and it can assist with Red Hat Satellite system management.

    Ansible can finish provisioning application servers post-installation, using the ansible-pull script.

    Ansible can orchestrate zero-downtime rollover application upgrades.

    Native SSH is Ansibleâ€™s default connection plug-in, but the Paramiko plug-in provides efficient SSH communications with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 systems.
